# My Personal Project

## Project Description

My project will be a **shopping wishlist application** in which users can create a list of items they want to buy or receive as gifts. They will also be able to add friends, view their wishlists, and create "gift lists" based on what they want to purchase for their friends. Target users include anyone who often keeps track of items they are interested in and enjoy gift shopping for their family and friends. I am interested in developing this idea because it is an application that would be very helpful and convenient for myself to use. I often make note of items to buy for my friends so an application designed specifically for this purpose would be useful.
