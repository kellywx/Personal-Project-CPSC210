# My Personal Project

## Project Description

My project will be a **shopping wishlist application** in which users can create a list of items they want to buy or receive as gifts. Users can also create to-buy lists and add items they want to buy for others. Additionally, they can enter an amount of money they have and keep track of how much money they have left after buying certain items. Target users include anyone who often keeps track of items they are interested in and enjoy gift shopping for their family and friends. I am interested in developing this idea because it is an application that would be very helpful and convenient for myself to use. I often make note of items to buy for my friends so an application designed specifically for this purpose would be useful.
